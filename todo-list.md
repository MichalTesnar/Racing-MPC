# Work it harder, make it better...

- steering: balancing
    - maximum steering angle at one time
    - maximum rate of change of steering at one step
    - lateral acceleration
    -> if the car is too constrained it drives quite bad, since it speeds into a corner and then we have to wait for a long time

# ... our work is never over.
