# Work it harder, make it better...

- refine changes in constraints with respect to the last position
- refine the grid of options to search
- do parameter search base on how far along the track we go
- optimize search on the track - matlab trick, convex optimization, last
- point and lookhead horizon, search track just from the point where you were

... our work is never over.
