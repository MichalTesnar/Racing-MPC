# Work it harder, make it better...

## To-do now
- poster/short report (4 pages?)
- potential testing of parameters and choices, benchmarking of design choices
- implementation in the simulation (just technical)
    
## To implement later
- fixating constants for car and developing a metric for performance
    - fixating the number of steps to measure how far it can go
- real time deployment in simulation: not very theoretical, more like application
- different specification of the problem
    
# ... our work is never over.
