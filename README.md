# Optimal Racing Using Model Predictive Control
## What is this?
In this project, we are trying to utilize model predictive control in order to make a car pick steering commands which make it race optimally.

## What do I need?
- Matlab (developed in 2022b, I am unsure about backwards compatibility),
- Matlab Optimization Toolbox version 9.4.
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox version 12.5

## What to run?
Firstly, go to `/utils` and run `precompute_grid.m`. Then comeback to the main folder, execute the file `no_noncon.m` and all the magic should happen.
